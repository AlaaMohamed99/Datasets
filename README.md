# Datasets
## this Repository is dedicated for Code conversion Graduation project, it's proposed to share files regarding the Project and keep each other updated with each other work
### Project team members:
- Ahmed Hamed
- Alaa Mohammed 
- Abdelhamid Khaled
- Mostafa M.Badawy
- Ahmed Taha Fekry
### **Project Main Purpose**:
in this project we create a program that converts code base of any mobile development framework to any other mobile framework such as: Android(Java or Kotlin) to swift 
or swift to React Native and so on. For this purpose we use Antlr4 to parse each framework grammer (Source framework) using its grammer file and from the generated codes we create
the parsing tree of the other framework(target framework)

### What we Accomplished:
   - we created some mini-Applications (the same applications for each framework) as a Dataset to clarify whether our Code translator works correctly
   - we gathered grammer files suitable for each framework 
### TODO:
  - using the antlr4 to generate target framework given the source framework grammer file
  - deploying the program for use
